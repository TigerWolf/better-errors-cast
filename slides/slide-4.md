##Is there more?

Lets also install binding-of-caller.

This gives us other tools

Lets add binding-of-caller to our gemfile

``gem 'binding_of_caller'``

This gives us more information about the place in the code and also gives us a cool console that allows us to debug what went wrong.

Now I will show you a Demo.
